#Stock Simulation

This python program was developed as a way to test "Shannon's Demon", a rebalancing method to generate a "guaranteed" return on a portfolio.

The program supports both fake stocks (governed by predetermined functions) and real stocks (which draw from yahoofinance historical stock data).

The program also generates portfolios which rebalance every trading interval.
At the end, the portfolios are graphed to compare their performances.

The project is still a work in progress.
